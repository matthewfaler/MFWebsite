        Hello, my name is Matthew Faler and I am a dual-degreed Computer Scientist and Mathematician from Sandy Springs, GA. 
        I received my Bachelors of Science in both Computer Science and Mathematics from The University of Georgia after having gone to The University of Alabama for three years. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My aspiration is to find a space where I can maximize my potential as a Mathematician as well as a Computer Scientist. Areas of great 
        interest to me would be any object oriented programming endeavor, web development, data science/engineering, artificial intelligence, and any algorithmic work.
    </p>
    <p>
        My hope for this website is to have a place where I can easily show my skills as a programmer as well as to communicate my interests with potential hiring managers or any others interested in my skills and 
        expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am open to any remote roles. Locations that I would be interested in for in-person/hybrid work would be mostly focused in the southeastern United States.
        (Preferrably nowhere west of Texas or North of North Carolina)
