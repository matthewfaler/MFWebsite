            Hello, my name is Matthew Faler and I am a dual-degreed Computer Scientist and Mathematician 
            from Sandy Springs, GA. I received my Bachelors of Science in both Computer Science and 
            Mathematics from The University of Georgia after having gone to The University of Alabama for three years. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My aspiration is to find a space where I can maximize my potential as a Mathematician as 
            well as a Computer Scientist. Areas of great interest to me would be any object oriented 
            programming endeavor, web development, data science/engineering, artificial intelligence, 
            and any algorithmic computing work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am open to any remote roles. Locations that I would be interested in for in-person/hybrid 
            work would be mostly focused in the southeastern United States. (Preferrably nowhere west 
            of Texas or North of North Carolina)
        </p>
        <p>
            My hope for this website is to have a place where I can easily show my skills as a 
            programmer as well as to communicate my interests with potential hiring managers or 
            any others interested in my skills and expertise.
